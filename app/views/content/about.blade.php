        At DiscoverCooks, we have a couple of goals. One, to work with recipe creators to enable them to promote themselves and their recipes. Two, to give our user base the best product possible that enables them to cook more recipes. Three, to become a place where food lovers of any skill can come together and take away something positive.

        We highly value our user base and it is in our best interest for you to succeed. This is evident in our revenue sharing model where we take the majority of the money we generate and give it back to our users. Our success is based on yours and due to that, we will always try to work with you in order to provide the best product that we possible can.
